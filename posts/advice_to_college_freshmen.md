# My Advice to Incoming College Freshmen

Hi, I am a college senior. If you are an incoming college freshman, here is my advice:

There is no path I can tell you to take, and the most valuable college experiences occur when you don't know what to do and you figure it out on your own. Thus, I will only say 4 things:

1. **Prestigious careers are NOT reserved for people with incredibly high natural intelligence.**  
   They are reserved for people who want them the most. They get up and try their hardest every day over the course of a long period of time. You can become a doctor, lawyer, bodybuilder, quantum physicist, tiktoker, paramedic—pretty much anything.  
   *Book recommendation:* *Atomic Habits*

2. **Be a good person.**  
   Life is peaceful & people start respecting your ideas if you appear calm, composed, mature, and do no harm to others.  
   *Book recommendation:* *The Let Them Theory* and/or *Right Thing, Right Now*

3. **Understand there are hundreds of scientists at Meta and Bytedance trying to ruin your life.**  
   These scientists spend 40+ hours a week studying the optimal ways to get kids addicted to screens. Limit your non-productive screen time to 1 hour a day and you will become happier.  
   *Book recommendation:* *The Anxious Generation*

4. **Just do things.**  
   If you want to jetski, dune surf, climb a mountain, join a frat/sorority, learn to surf, start a company—just try. You don't have to be successful, just get up and try it.  
   There is no book for this one, literally just get up and do something interesting.

I could list 100s of bullet points if I wanted to tell you what exactly to do. However, you learn the most when you are not told what to do. Go out there and do stuff that feels right.
