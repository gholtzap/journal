# You know about crypto for the wrong reasons

When I hear people talk about crypto, they're always talking about something stupid like $DOGE, $PEPE, etc, or pump.fun shenanigans. These gimmicks are a distraction from what's actually important in the crypto world: the blockchain. Here is why payments are broken, how the blockchain solves it, and my predictions for the next decade.

If you've sent money via Venmo, you probably think digital payments are solved. They're not.

Try sending $500 to someone in the Philippines right now. You'll discover that "instant" digital payments are mostly an illusion that only works within specific apps, specific countries, and specific banking systems. Step outside those boundaries and you're back to the government's ancient wire transfer system that takes 3-5 business days and costs $25-50 in fees.

This isn't a technology problem. We've had the internet for decades. It's a regulatory problem.

## **Why Sending Money Is Still Hard**

Modern payment systems are built on rails from the 1970s. When you send money through your bank:

1. Your bank sends an ACH request
2. The request sits in a queue and gets processed in batches
3. The receiving bank gets notified 1-3 days later

This system was designed for an era of paper checks and physical ledgers. The delays aren't technical limitations, they're baked into the architecture because banks, regulators, and intermediaries all have reasons to keep it slow. [Watch](https://youtu.be/YjUwajAc1oE?si=R-GMoml6_K5Jx8Gn)

Apps like Venmo and CashApp haven't actually solved this. They've just hidden it. When you send money on Venmo, the app credits you immediately from Venmo's own funds, then settles with your bank later using the same old ACH rails.

## **The Blockchain**

The blockchain offers a payment rail that isn't owned by any single entity. When you send cryptocurrency:

- Transactions settle in minutes or less, not days
- Nobody holds or controls your funds
- It works the same whether you're sending to your neighbor or your grandma in the Philippines
- Operates 24/7, including weekends and holidays

## **The Adoption Gap**

For most people, crypto payments still can't compete with the convenience of tapping a credit card.

To make blockchain payments genuinely useful for everyday people, two things need to happen:

**1. Getting paid in crypto needs to be seamless**

Major payroll providers like ADP, Rippling, and Workday would need to integrate crypto as a standard payment option, the same way they handle direct deposit today.

**2. Spending crypto needs to be as easy as spending dollars**

We need major payment processors (Stripe, Square, Adyen) to build crypto acceptance into their core products. If Stripe (which processes hundreds of billions in payments annually) made crypto a standard checkout option, Amazon, Doordash, Shopify, and hundreds more notable online merchants would suddenly be crypto-accessible.

## **Why This Hasn't Happened Yet**

Merchants won't accept crypto until customers demand it; customers won't use crypto until merchants accept it.

## **What Happens Next**

Here's what will happen:

1. Payment providers will start allowing users to pay in crypto
2. Crypto will become mainstream
3. Government will make many laws trying to undercut crypto payments
4. People will fight back
5. HR will start paying employees in crypto
6. Banks and ACH will become legacy technology, similar to cash
